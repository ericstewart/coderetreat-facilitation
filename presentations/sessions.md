## Closing Circle

Everyone stand and gather around in a circle. We will go around and each 3 questions.

Take a minute or two to think before we begin. Keep it short as we go around.

* What--if anything--surprised you today?
* What--if anything--did you learn today?
* What--if anything--will you do differently on Monday or in the future?
