### Global Day of Coderetreat

This year, we have 141 participating cities, with 2,500 expected software developers!

This year's Global Day of Coderetreat is supporting CoderDojo: a worldwide, volunteer-driven movement of programming clubs for young people. Any funds not used to support GDCR will go to CoderDojo.

### GDCR Supports CoderDojo
#### The global network of free computer programming clubs for young people.

CoderDojo is a global movement of free, volunteer-led,  community based programming clubs for young people.

## Pair Programming

* Two people per computer
* Decide on language
* Work together
* **Who** does **what**?

---

## Test-Driven Development (TDD)

---

### TDD Lifecycle

1. Add a test
2. Run all tests and see if the new one fails
3. Write some code
4. Run tests
5. Refactor code
6. Repeat

---

### Participant Introductions

* Get a name tag
* Put your name and preferred languages on the whiteboard

---

## [fit] The 4 Rules of Simple Design

---

## Simple Design

1. Passes All Its Tests
2. Clearly Expresses Intent
3. Contains No Duplication
5. Has No Superflous Parts

---

## SOLID Principles

---

## Single Responsibility Principle

An object should have only a single responsibility

---

## Open/Closed Principle

Software entitites should be open for extension but closed for modification

---

## Liskov Substitution Principle

Ojbects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctnesss of that program

---

## Interface Segregation Principle

Many client specific interfaces are better than one general purpose interface

---

## Dependency Inversion Principle

One should "Depend upon abstractions. Do not depend upon concretions." Dependency injection is one example of following this principle.

## Closing Circle

Everyone stand and gather around in a circle. We will go around and each answer the following 3 questions.

Take a minute or two to think before we begin.

* What--if anything--surprised you today?
* What--if anything--did you learn today?
* What--if anything--will you do differently on Monday or in the future?
